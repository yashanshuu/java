(Already shown in the theory session)

3. Revise class work using 
3.1 Refer to "day1-data\day1_help\sequence.txt
3.2 Refer to code samples from : day1.1


4. Go through some of the readymade code samples given for practice.
day1_help\rdy_code\Test1.txt, Test2.txt ,Test3.txt, Test4.txt
(Refer to while & switch-case syntax carefully)
